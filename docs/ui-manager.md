# CAI UI Manager

A class-based widget framework for the CAI accessibility mod. Provides
TTS-friendly focus, navigation, speech, and input handling on top of Civ VI's
Lua UI runtime. This document is the source of truth for the new manager; the
matching LuaLS annotations live in `src/ideHelpers.lua`.

---

## 1. Architecture

The manager has four layers:

1. **Manager** (`CAIUIScreenManager.lua`) — singleton hung off
   `ExposedMembers.CAI_UIManager`. Owns the widget stack, the canonical focus
   path, input dispatch, and speech announcement on focus change.
2. **Base classes** — `UIWidget` → `ContainerWidget` and `ValueWidget`. Real
   class inheritance via metatable chains; not the old template-merging model.
3. **Concrete widgets** — Button, MenuItem, StaticText, Panel, Dialog,
   Dropdown, List, HorizontalList, SubMenu, Tree, TreeItem, Checkbox, Slider,
   EditBox, TabControl, Tab, TabPage, Grid, Graph, DataTable, GameView, InterfaceMode. Each is
   one file under `src/UI/uiManager/`.
4. **Helpers** (`src/UI/uiManager/helpers/`) — stateless utilities used by
   widgets and the manager: navigation, search, tree walks, edit-box logic,
   dialog builders.

Construction always goes through the registry. A screen calls
`mgr:CreateWidget(id, type, props)`; the registry looks up the type name and
calls the matching class constructor, which builds a new instance, applies the
props, and returns it.

```lua
local btn = mgr:CreateWidget("Btn_Save", "Button", {
    Label   = function() return Locale.Lookup("LOC_CAI_SAVE") end,
    Tooltip = function() return saveBtn:GetToolTipString() end,
})
btn:On("activate", function() vanillaSaveAction() end)
panel:AddChild(btn)
```

## 2. Class hierarchy

```
UIWidget                       identity, tree, events, input, speech
├── ContainerWidget            navigable parent (Ctrl+F search via AllowSearch)
│   ├── PanelWidget
│   │   └── SearchPanelWidget  Ctrl+F overlay (managed singleton)
│   ├── DialogWidget
│   ├── ListWidget             AllowSearch=true by default
│   ├── HorizontalListWidget
│   ├── SubMenuWidget
│   ├── TreeWidget             AllowSearch=true by default
│   ├── TreeItemWidget
│   ├── TabPageWidget
│   ├── TabControlWidget
│   ├── DropdownWidget         container of an inner List of MenuItems
│   ├── GridWidget             spatial columns/tiers; arbitrary widget cells
│   ├── GraphWidget            directed nodes/edges; relationship navigation
│   ├── DataTableWidget        sortable homogeneous rows; player role Table
│   ├── GameViewWidget
│   └── InterfaceModeWidget
├── ValueWidget                stateful value with bound setter
│   ├── CheckboxWidget
│   ├── SliderWidget
│   └── EditBoxWidget
├── ButtonWidget               leaf
├── MenuItemWidget             leaf
├── StaticTextWidget           leaf
└── TabWidget                  leaf, parented to a TabControl
```

Inheritance is real: each concrete class has its own metatable that chains up
to `ContainerWidget`/`ValueWidget`/`UIWidget`. Instances are `setmetatable({},
ClassMT)` once at `Create`, so method lookup walks the chain without per-key
field copying.

---

## 3. Lifecycle

### Create

```lua
local w = mgr:CreateWidget(id, "Button", props)
```

- `id` must be non-empty and globally unique within the manager's stack scope.
  Use `mgr:GenerateWidgetId(prefix)` for transient/auto widgets.
- `type` must be registered. Each widget file registers itself at the bottom
  with `CAIWidgetRegistry.Register("TypeName", Class.Create)`.
- `props` is an instance-override table. Keys with a matching `Set<Name>`
  setter (e.g. `Label`, `Tooltip`, `WrapAround`, `FocusKey`, `Transparent`)
  route through the setter. Other keys assign directly to the instance.
- `StaticText` has only one spoken text channel. If a caller supplies both
  `Label` and `Tooltip`, the widget exposes them together from `GetLabel()`,
  separated by `[NEWLINE]`, and `GetTooltip()` returns an empty string. An
  empty label promotes the tooltip to the label; identical values are not
  repeated. Prefer putting the complete text in `Label` at new call sites.

### Push / Pop

```lua
mgr:Push(root, { priority = PopupPriority.Current, focus = "edit:name" })
mgr:Pop()
mgr:RemoveFromStack("ScreenRoot_City")
mgr:RemoveFromStack("ModalRoot", false) -- parent refresh immediately chooses final focus
```

- `priority` controls stack sort. Ties resolve by push order (FIFO).
- `stickyTop` floats this widget above *all* same-priority non-sticky widgets,
  regardless of push order. Use sparingly — it out-ranks every other root at the
  same priority, so it is easy to trap unrelated later pushes beneath it.
- `below` is a widget id. If that widget is on the stack at the same priority,
  the pushed widget is placed directly beneath it (only `stackOrder` is adjusted,
  so the sort remains a valid total order). This scopes ordering to one specific
  widget without the broad side effects of `stickyTop`. Example: the espionage
  chooser opens *after* a mission-completed `EspionagePopup`; passing
  `below = <popup id>` keeps the popup on top while both stay at `Low`.
- `focus` is a widget reference or a `FocusKey` string. Applied only when the
  pushed widget becomes the new top. Avoids screens reaching into
  `FocusedChild` to pre-position focus.
- `RemoveFromStack(id, false)` restores the next root silently. Use it only
  when the same synchronous close path immediately refreshes that parent and
  moves focus to the final destination; this prevents speaking an obsolete
  intermediate focus before the parent refresh completes.
- The active root is always the top of the stack. Focus follows automatically.

### Settings and replacement child views

Mod Settings belongs to the current accessible screen instead of becoming
another stack root. Follow the Input Help and Civilopedia lookup pattern:
`OpenSettings(mgr)` saves `mgr:GetFocusedWidget()`, creates a transparent,
wrapping, input-trapping Panel containing `CAISettingsTree`, adds the Panel to
the current root, and focuses the Tree directly. The Panel owns Escape and
switches to the Shell input context on focus. Ordinary closure destroys the
Panel and focuses the saved widget directly. Any code that must rediscover
these child widgets through the manager uses `GetWidgetById(id, true)`;
the default nonrecursive lookup checks stack roots only.

A view replacing Settings follows the same ownership. Resolve the parent with
`CAIWidgetHelpers_Settings.GetSettingsOwnerRoot(mgr)` and obtain the original
screen focus through `GetSettingsReturnFocus(mgr)`. Add the replacement panel
to that root and call `mgr:PrepareFocus(ownerRoot, initialChild)` before calling
`CloseSettings(mgr, false)`. The `false` preserves the replacement's prepared
focus rather than restoring the screen immediately. The replacement should
trap input and owns the saved widget so it can focus that widget when it closes.

### Event-driven tutorials

Each UI manager owns a `CAIUITutorialManager`, available through
`mgr:GetTutorialManager()`. Tutorial items are registered data definitions and
react to named checks in the same broad style as vanilla
`TutorialCheck(listenerName)`, but they do not use Firaxis advisor overlays,
tutorial priorities, or control filtering.

The first production item is `MAIN_MENU_UI_NAVIGATION`. The Main Menu checks
its `MainMenuOpened` event after its route is pushed, and the tutorial
introduces the mod interface and the manager's core keyboard navigation.
All localization owned by the mod tutorial system, including shared dialog and
settings text as well as item titles and content, belongs in
`src/Text/en_US/TutorialText_CAI.xml`. Keep unrelated accessibility strings,
including support for the game's own tutorial mode, in their existing locale
files.

`CAIUITutorialCatalog` owns stable screen-level definitions and matches them to
CAI stack-root ids after `UIScreenManager:Push()` has established focus. This
keeps one-time screen guidance centralized while still passing the live screen
root as the explicit tutorial owner. Contextual states which are not separate
stack roots must check their own named events: Production checks
`ProductionQueueOpened` when its Queue page becomes active, and World Congress
checks separate events for resolution voting, emergency-proposal voting, and
selecting a proposal for a future special session.

Every catalog definition also has a matching article in the Civilopedia's
dedicated `Accessibility Mod` section under `Screen Tutorials`. Screen
definitions derive their shared static title tag as
`LOC_CAI_TUTORIAL_<item id>_TITLE`; contextual definitions already declare
their title tag. The generated gameplay database file reuses each definition's
ordered `Content` tags as `Simple` article paragraphs.

The same section has ungrouped introduction, key-binding, and search/type-ahead
guides plus a `UI Widgets` group. That group has one article for each concrete
inheritance family: Leaf, Value, and Container widgets. Each included widget is
a titled chapter within its family article. The generated data defines a
family-specific page layout that uses the stock `Simple` script template, then
maps its ordered chapter ids through `CivilopediaPageLayoutChapters`,
`CivilopediaPageChapterHeaders`, and
`CivilopediaPageChapterParagraphs`.

The widget inventory is deliberately concrete: it documents widget types
exposed by in-game CAI screens, with `MenuItem` intentionally omitted from the
reference. Abstract base classes and the internal `HorizontalList` used to
implement tab strips also do not get player-facing chapters. Widget prose must
be audited against the class input maps, focus behavior, speech behavior, and
concrete in-game usage before it changes. Its localized text lives in
`src/Text/en_US/AccessibilityPediaText_CAI.xml`.

After changing catalog ids, titles, order or content, or the Civilopedia guide
and widget inventories, run `scripts/Generate-TutorialCivilopedia.ps1`.

A contextual tutorial raised by a tab or focus-change callback must be deferred
until the next context update. `TabControl` emits `value_changed` before every
focus path has finished settling, including the focus move performed after a
keyboard tab switch. Raising a child tutorial synchronously from that event can
let the remainder of the tab transaction steal focus back from the tutorial.
Schedule the check for the next update, cancel that pending update when the
screen closes, and make the tutorial check the final focus-affecting operation.

```lua
local tutorials = mgr:GetTutorialManager()

tutorials:RegisterItem({
    Id = "PRODUCTION_PANEL_INTRO",
    RaiseEvents = { "ProductionPanelOpened" },
    Order = 10,
    Queueable = false,
    Prerequisites = {},
    Title = "LOC_CAI_TUTORIAL_PRODUCTION_TITLE",
    Content = {
        "LOC_CAI_TUTORIAL_PRODUCTION_OVERVIEW",
        "LOC_CAI_TUTORIAL_PRODUCTION_NAVIGATION",
    },
    CanRaise = function(context)
        return context.cityId ~= nil
    end,
})

tutorials:Check("ProductionPanelOpened", productionRoot, {
    cityId = selectedCityId,
})
```

`Check(eventName, owner, context?)` requires the owning widget explicitly.
Eligible dialogs are added beneath that owner as a transparent, input-trapping
Panel containing a Dialog. They are not pushed as stack roots, so they remain
inside the current route and inherit the owning screen's popup priority just
like Settings and Civilopedia lookup. Always pass a live owner from the screen
which fires the check; do not infer ownership from whichever popup happens to
be on top.

Every dialog contains the definition's ordered StaticText rows, the shared
`Show mod tutorials` Checkbox, and one `Continue` action. Escape is consumed;
Continue is the completion path. Continue persists
the current reset generation to `Tutorials/Seen_<item.Id>` through
`CAI.SetConfigValue`, invokes optional
`OnContinue(context, item)`, closes the child Panel, and restores the prior
focus. If persistence fails, the dialog remains open and announces the failure.
Destroying the owner closes the dialog without marking it seen.

The UI section of Mod Settings contains two tutorial controls:

- `Show mod tutorials` is the default-enabled `ShowTutorials` Checkbox. When
  false, new checks do nothing and queued items are cleared.
- `Reset mod tutorials` is the `ResetModTutorials` action Button. It emits
  `LuaEvents.CAISettingsChanged("ResetModTutorials", "reset")`, advances the
  persisted tutorial reset generation, and speaks `Tutorials reset`. It does
  not close Settings or move focus.

Generation-based reset makes every older completion record logically unseen,
including tutorials whose defining screens are not currently loaded. Seen
state is profile-global, not save-game state. String `Title` and `Content`
entries are localization tags; functions must return already-localized text
and receive `(context, item)`.

Items with the same raise event are evaluated by ascending `Order`, then
registration order. Only one tutorial is active. `Queueable` defaults to false,
matching vanilla's conservative behavior; queued items open only if their owner
is still live and becomes the current stack route. `Prerequisites` contains
stable item ids which must already be seen.

Public methods:

- `RegisterItem(definition)` / `RegisterItems(definitions)`
- `Check(eventName, owner, context?)`
- `IsSeen(itemId)` / `MarkSeen(itemId)`
- `ResetSeen(itemId)` / `ResetAllSeen()`
- `AreTutorialsEnabled()` / `IsActive()`
- `Continue()` / `ClearQueue()`

### Destroy

```lua
w:Destroy()
```

- Emits `destroy` on `w` first (listeners may clean up subscriptions).
- Calls `Manager:NotifyDestroy(w)` so the focus path silently truncates from
  this widget downward. Screens are expected to follow rebuilds with their
  own `SetFocus` or `RestoreFocus` — no automatic re-speak.
- Recursively destroys children, clears listeners, nils refs.

---

## 4. Focus model

The manager is the single source of truth for focus. There is no per-widget
`FocusedChild` field that the framework respects — screens that try to write
it directly are bypassing the model.

### Canonical state

`Manager.CurrentPath` is an ordered array of widgets from root (top of stack)
to the focused leaf. `Manager:GetFocusedWidget()` returns `CurrentPath[#CurrentPath]`.

### Setting focus

```lua
mgr:SetFocus(widget)                                  -- re-entry / programmatic
mgr:SetFocus(widget, { direction = 1, announce = true }) -- directional nav
mgr:SetFocus(widget, false)                           -- legacy boolean = announce=false
```

A screen that is shown with no readable view (e.g. a cinematic intro where every
vanilla container is hidden) should give the manager a Transparent, childless
focus-holder widget to land on rather than trying to focus nothing — `SetFocus`
with no target is not a supported "clear focus" path. Gate that holder's
`HiddenPredicate` on the cinematic state so normal navigation skips it.

`SetFocus` calls `BuildFocusPath(widget, direction)`:

1. Walks `widget.Parent` chain to the root, producing a `[root, ..., widget]`
   prefix.
1a. Auto-expands any collapsed expandable ancestor in that prefix (calls
   `anc:Expand(true)` — silent, no event) so a focus target buried inside a
   collapsed TreeItem/SubMenu is reachable and visible. The target itself
   keeps its own expand state.
2. Descends from `widget` to a leaf. Each step calls one of:
   - `GetEntryChild(direction)` if `direction` is set (Windows tab-stop
     semantics: forward → first visible, backward → last visible).
   - `GetDefaultChild()` otherwise (re-entry / `RestoreFocus` / `Push focus`
     path: uses cached `_lastFocusedKey` → `_lastFocusedChild` → `DefaultIndex`
     → first visible).

Then `ApplyFocus`:

- Emits `focus_leave` on the old path from the divergence index downward.
- Emits `focus_enter` on the new path from the divergence index downward.
- Updates each parent's `_lastFocusedChild` and `_lastFocusedKey` hints.
- Plays `_focusSound` (via `UI.PlaySound`) on newly entered widgets that
  have one.

Then `BuildAnnouncement` collects per-widget speech strings for everything
from the divergence index downward, skipping any widget marked `Transparent`,
and `SpeakLines(announcements, true)` speaks them — first line interrupts,
rest queue.

The Focused Widget Reader caches the focused widget's eligible speech elements
in the canonical `BuildSpeech()` order, deliberately excluding role, state,
and position and bypassing normal per-widget/global speech suppression for the
included elements. It joins them with `[NEWLINE]`, guaranteeing that one element
can never be merged into the same reader section as another. It then uses the
shared `SplitTextIntoLines(text, maxLength)` utility to provide
previous, next, first, and last section navigation. The splitter preserves
explicit `[NEWLINE]` / physical-line boundaries and groups complete sentences
up to the default 75-character target. A sentence longer than the target
remains intact on its own line. Every widget follows this path, including
`StaticText`; there are no type-specific reader exceptions.

Screen Lua may likewise join player-facing speech sections with `[NEWLINE]`.
This convention is screen-scoped: UI-manager speech composition and utility,
helper, logic, and data modules retain separators appropriate to their own
contracts.

### Direction semantics

- `direction = 1` (forward / Tab / Down / Right / PgDn): entering a container
  lands on its first visible child when that container uses directional entry;
  otherwise it lands on its cached default child.
- `direction = -1` (backward / Shift+Tab / Up / Left / PgUp): entering a
  container lands on its last visible child when that container uses
  directional entry; otherwise it lands on its cached default child.
- `direction = nil/0` (programmatic): entering a container lands on its
  cached default child.

This is the **only** place Windows tab-stop convention kicks in. By default,
only `Transparent` layout containers use that directional first/last descent;
set `UseDirectionalEntry = false` on a transparent container to opt it back
into normal cached-default re-entry. After a
rebuild, `RestoreFocus` deliberately omits direction so the user lands where
they were, not at the start/end of the new children.

### Container entry overrides

- `SubMenuWidget:GetEntryChild` / `GetDefaultChild` return nil while collapsed
  **or** while expanded but with no remembered focus child (no
  `_lastFocusedChild` / `_lastFocusedKey`) — mirrors `TreeItem`. So a bare
  `Expand(true)` (e.g. `BuildFocusPath` opening an ancestor, or a seeded node)
  leaves the submenu a focus stop instead of auto-entering its first child;
  only an explicit `EnterFirstChild` (Enter/Right from the collapsed node)
  descends. `EnterFirstChild` is a no-op once expanded, so a Right/Enter that
  bubbles up from a child does not re-enter and yank focus back to the first.
- `TreeItemWidget:GetEntryChild` returns nil while collapsed (same).
- `TabControlWidget` inherits the default — Shift+Tab into it lands on the
  active page (last child), Tab forward into it lands on the tab strip (first
  child). Override if your screen needs different semantics.

### Stable focus across rebuilds

Widgets that get rebuilt (lists driven by game state, tree views, queue rows)
should set `FocusKey` to a stable string identifying the row across rebuilds:

```lua
row.FocusKey = "production:queue:row:" .. unitId
```

The screen wraps the rebuild with capture + restore:

```lua
local capture = mgr:CaptureFocusKey(treeRoot)
treeRoot:ClearChildren()
RebuildTree(treeRoot, gameData)
mgr:RestoreFocus(treeRoot, capture)
```

`CaptureFocusKey` walks from the focused leaf up to `root` and returns
`{ key, path }` — `key` is the deepest `FocusKey` on the path (or nil),
`path` is the index path as a fallback. It returns `nil` when focus is not
inside `root` (including the "no focus yet" first-paint case).

`RestoreFocus` is scoped to the rebuilt subtree: **a nil capture is a no-op**,
so a passive rebuild never steals focus from elsewhere or plants initial
focus. When capture is non-nil it tries in order: match `key` via DFS → walk
`path` clamping out-of-range or hidden cells → fall back to the first visible
child of `root` (the item under focus went away). Initial focus on screen
open is set by `Push` itself (via `UpdateRootFocus` → `SetFocus(top)`); do
not rely on `RestoreFocus` to anchor it.

The `key` match restores silently (`announce = false`) — same logical position,
nothing new to say. The `path` walk and first-visible-child fallback re-`SetFocus`
and **speak**, since the original item moved or went away and the user should
hear where focus landed. The `path` walk also **stops at a collapsed expandable**
(a node whose `IsExpanded` is false): the captured position pointed inside a
subtree the rebuild left closed, so focus lands on the collapsed node rather than
silently re-opening it (which previously auto-entered submenus / tree items).

Dropdown option rows automatically use `<dropdown focus key or id>:option:<index>`
as their `FocusKey`, preferring the dropdown's stable `FocusKey` when present.
Setting focus to any dropdown descendant silently opens its dropdown
ancestor, just as focusing inside a collapsed tree or submenu expands that
ancestor. When an option key matches after a rebuild, `RestoreFocus` therefore
returns to the option inside the open dropdown instead of landing on its outer
control.

Dropdown commit is deliberately different from passive refresh. It temporarily
sets the manager's `FocusRestoreKeyOverride` to the outer dropdown's stable key
while its value setter and `value_changed` handlers run. The new value is thus
committed before close, but a synchronous rebuild restores directly to the
closed replacement dropdown instead of reopening its option row. The prior
override is restored afterward so the transaction remains scoped.

A screen that is itself about to move focus elsewhere after a rebuild (e.g. the
diplomacy ActionView rebuilds its statement list inside `SelectPlayer` and then
hands focus to the conversation list) should skip the restore for that pass —
pass a `nil` capture so `RestoreFocus` no-ops — rather than relying on a silent
restore. The default restore is meant to speak.

When vanilla refreshes part of a screen, CAI refreshes only the mirrored widget
container for that same vanilla-owned area. Do not remove and re-push the whole
CAI root, and do not rebuild unrelated sibling widgets, unless the user
explicitly asks for that behavior or vanilla has actually closed/reopened the
whole screen. For list/tree/table/grid refreshes, keep the root mounted and use the
container-local focus tools above (`CaptureFocusKey` / `RestoreFocus`, or
`PrepareFocus` when the rebuilt container is not currently focused). This avoids
spurious root-focus resets such as tab-strip focus bouncing into a refreshed
tree and back out.

### Re-announcing without re-focusing

When a focused widget's data updates due to a game event:

```lua
Events.SomeGameStateChanged.Add(function()
    if mgr:GetFocusedWidget() == myWidget then
        mgr:Refocus()
    end
end)
```

`Refocus()` re-speaks the current leaf using `BuildAnnouncement` over the leaf
only. `focus_enter`/`focus_leave` are not re-fired.

To announce a specific widget out of band:

```lua
otherWidget:Announce()                  -- all canonical elements
otherWidget:Announce({ "value" })       -- only the value element
```

---

## 5. Speech model

Speech is **one TTS line per widget** — the Windows screen-reader convention.
Focus changes produce N lines (N = widgets in the path tail from the
divergence index), all sent through `SpeakLines(lines, true)`. First line
interrupts ongoing speech; the rest queue so per-widget lines don't trample
each other.

### What gets spoken per widget

`UIWidget:BuildSpeech(elements?)` assembles a string from these canonical
elements, in order:

1. `label` — `GetLabel()`
2. `role` — `Locale.Lookup("LOC_UIWidget_Role_" .. (Role or Type))`
3. `state` — disabled marker + `GetState()`
4. `value` — `GetValue()`
5. `tooltip` — `GetTooltip()`
6. `position` — supplied only by an ordered navigation container. Direct
   items in `List`, `Tree`, `TreeItem`, `SubMenu`, and a `TabControl`'s tab
   strip use `Locale.Lookup("LOC_UIWidget_Element_Pos", visIdx, visTotal)`.
   `DataTable` and `Grid` cells use row/column coordinates, while `Graph`
   nodes use their index in the live Up/Down alternative set. Widgets under
   ordinary layout containers, including generic `Container`, `Panel`,
   `Dialog`, and `HorizontalList`, do not speak a position.

Each element is included only if non-empty. The widget's `SpeechSettings`
table can mute individual elements (`SpeechSettings = { Role = false }`),
and the manager's `CAISettings` table has global toggles (`speakLabel`,
`speakRole`, ...).

### Transparent widgets

A widget marked `Transparent = true` is skipped entirely by
`BuildAnnouncement`. Use this for layout-only containers — the dialog button
row is the canonical example. Transparent containers also use directional
first/last entry by default; set `UseDirectionalEntry = false` when a
transparent container should stay silent in speech but still restore its
cached/default child on entry.

### Custom speech triggers

- `ValueWidget:SetValue(v)` (non-silent) speaks the value element after firing
  `value_changed`.
- `TreeItemWidget:Expand/Collapse` speak the value element on toggle so the
  user hears "expanded, 5 items" / "collapsed", and focus speech announces the
  same state on every node as the user navigates (the standard tree readout).
  The crucial rule: **only user-driven toggles speak**. Both methods take a
  `silent` flag (`Expand(true)` / `Collapse(true)`) that suppresses **both** the
  `expanded`/`collapsed` event and the speech — every automatic or programmatic
  caller passes it (seeding initial state, the focus-path ancestor auto-expand,
  a screen's re-expand listener), so navigation and deliberate Left/Right/Enter
  toggles are the only things that ever speak the state. The default (no flag),
  used by the Tree key handlers, is the user-driven speaking path.
  `Collapse` always tears down its whole subtree: every descendant is collapsed
  (silently, no events) so a later re-expand reveals one clean level. Seed
  initial expand state with `Expand(true)` after children exist; only fall back
  to a direct `IsExpanded = true` write when children are added later (the leaf
  guard makes `Expand` a no-op on a childless node). `SubMenuWidget`
  expand/collapse don't speak a value at all — the focus change announces.
- `EditBoxWidget` speaks per-keystroke characters, deleted text, selection
  changes, line content on Up/Down, etc. — all routed through `Speak(.., true)`
  for the interrupting feel. A successful buffer mutation speaks its typed,
  pasted, deleted, cancelled, or programmatic value feedback before emitting
  `text_changed`, so listener work cannot interrupt the edit echo.

### Speech setting precedence

```
SpeechSettings[Key] == false       → mute on this widget
CAISettings["speak"..Key] == false → mute globally
otherwise → include if the info string is non-empty
```

### `IgnoreWhenNotFocused`

`SpeechSettings = { IgnoreWhenNotFocused = true }` makes a widget contribute
to focus-change speech only when it is the focus leaf. Useful for TreeItems
which would otherwise re-announce themselves while focus passes through their
subtree.

---

## 6. Event system

Multi-listener, snapshot-iterated events on every widget.

```lua
local token = widget:On("activate", function(w) ... end)
widget:Off("activate", token)
widget:Emit("activate")
widget:Emit("value_changed", newValue)
```

Listeners receive `(widget, ...extraArgs)`. The snapshot semantics mean a
handler can add or remove listeners during dispatch without breaking
iteration.

### Standard events

| Event             | When fired                                                   | Extra args |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `focus_enter`     | Widget or descendant became part of CurrentPath              | `(path, index)` |
| `focus_leave`     | Widget left CurrentPath                                      | `(path, index)` |
| `activate`        | Button / MenuItem / TreeItem-leaf activation                 | —          |
| `value_changed`   | `SetValue` (non-silent), `Toggle`, `Increment`/`Decrement`, EditBox `Commit` | `(newValue)` |
| `expanded`        | TreeItem or SubMenu expanded                                 | —          |
| `collapsed`       | TreeItem or SubMenu collapsed                                | —          |
| `destroy`         | First step of `Destroy`; listeners should clean up           | —          |

`navigation_wrap` fires after a successful navigation move crosses a wrapping
container or TabControl boundary. Its extra argument is the direction (`1` or
`-1`). The manager's default listener plays the `UI_MENU_WRAP` raw-audio cue.

### `focus_enter` contract

`focus_enter` fires on **every newly-populated path slot**, not only the
focus leaf. A handler on a Panel will fire when focus moves into any
descendant. To do work only when the widget *is* the leaf, check
`w:IsFocused()` inside the handler.

`Manager.CurrentPath` is committed **before** events fire, so `IsFocused()`
and `Manager:GetFocusedWidget()` reflect the post-change state from inside
the handler. Speech still runs after all events have fired (the manager
assembles announcement strings once `ApplyFocus` returns), so handlers can
update vanilla control state — labels, selection, tooltip text — and that
new state is what gets spoken. Inside a `focus_leave` handler, `IsFocused()`
is false; the old path is available as the event's first extra arg if you
need it.

---

## 7. Value / action model

`ValueWidget` is the base for stateful widgets. Pattern:

```lua
local checkbox = mgr:CreateWidget(id, "Checkbox", {
    Label = function() return "Notifications" end,
})
checkbox:SetValueSetter(function(_, v) gameSettings.notifications = v end)
checkbox:On("value_changed", function(_, v) print("now", v) end)
checkbox:Toggle()
```

- `SetValue(v, silent)` — sets internal value, calls the bound setter (unless
  silent), emits `value_changed`, speaks the value element.
- `GetValue()` — returns the internal value.
- `SetValueSetter(fn)` — function called when the value changes through the
  widget. Use this to push the value into the vanilla game system. EditBox
  `Commit` runs the same setter. Enter commits for all non-read-only edit
  boxes by default. Set `EnterToCommit = false` to make Enter bubble instead
  (useful when a parent confirm binding should handle it).

For EditBox: the buffer/commit phase is internal. Per-keystroke editing
mutates `_buffer` only — no events fire. `Commit()` promotes the buffer to
`_value`, calls the setter, and emits `value_changed` once. The convention
for distinguishing user commits from programmatic refresh is the `silent`
flag on `SetText` / `SetValue`: refresh calls pass `silent=true` and emit
nothing; user commits run non-silent and fire `value_changed`.
All non-read-only edit boxes commit on Enter by default (`EnterToCommit`
is true). Set `EnterToCommit = false` to make Enter bubble — useful when a
parent confirm wrapper should handle the commit. `AlwaysEdit` writable
boxes auto-commit on focus leave by default. Set `CommitOnFocusLeave = false`
when a screen should preserve the live buffer while focus moves away.
For writable `AlwaysEdit`, `HighlightOnEdit` selects the existing text when
focus lands on the widget. That selection is silent because focus entry is not a
user-driven edit command; the manager's normal focus speech reads the selected
value once. When `HighlightOnEdit` is off, focus entry does not reposition the
cursor. Read-only `AlwaysEdit` viewers preserve their cursor when focus leaves
and returns.
`EditBox:GetTooltip()` prepends a live interaction hint to any tooltip supplied
by the screen. `AlwaysEdit` boxes prepend `LOC_CAI_EDIT_HINT_TYPE_TEXT`;
inactive non-`AlwaysEdit` boxes prepend `LOC_CAI_EDIT_HINT_PRESS_ENTER`.
Read-only boxes never add an interaction hint. An active non-`AlwaysEdit` box
also exposes only its screen-specific tooltip.

Direct methods are preferred over string-dispatched actions. EditBox exposes
`BeginEdit`, `Commit`, `Cancel`. Checkbox: `Toggle`, `SetChecked`. Slider:
`Increment`, `Decrement`, `PageIncrement`, `PageDecrement`. Dropdown:
`SetOptions`, `SetSelectedIndex`, `GetSelectedIndex`, `Commit`, `Open`,
`Close`, `IsOpen`.

Slider `SetMin` / `SetMax` are configuration operations. If a new bound clamps
the current internal value, that clamp is silent: it does not call the backing
setter, emit `value_changed`, or announce a value. Screens should seed the live
value explicitly with `SetValue(value, true)` after configuring the bounds.

### Dropdown open / commit

Dropdown is a ContainerWidget that owns a single inner List of MenuItems —
one per option. The list's label mirrors the dropdown label (so opening
re-announces context) and its position-in-parent is suppressed (it is the
dropdown's only child). The list is hidden via a hidden predicate keyed on
`_isOpen`, so when closed the dropdown has no navigable children and arrow
keys bubble to the enclosing list/panel.

Enter on a closed dropdown calls `Open()`: unhides the list, focuses the
MenuItem matching the committed selection, emits `opened`. Inside the open
list the existing List navigation handles Up/Down/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown
and type-to-find with wrap-around — no preview state to maintain. Activating
a MenuItem calls `dropdown:Commit(i)`, which fires `value_changed` and
closes (returning focus to the dropdown so the new value is announced).
Escape on an open dropdown closes without changing the value (the binding
lives on the dropdown so it catches the key bubbling up from MenuItem →
List → Dropdown). Losing focus while open closes silently — no event, no
SetFocus back to the dropdown.

Screens that mirror a vanilla `PullDown` listen for `opened` / `closed` and
call `pulldown:SetOpen(true/false)` so the vanilla panel tracks the widget's
mode. The silent focus_leave close skips the event because the screen is
typically already tearing down the vanilla control on that path; call
`Close()` explicitly from screen code if you need the event.

---

## 8. Input dispatch

Civ VI routes raw input through context-bound handlers. The CAI manager
installs `Manager:HandleInput(input)` for the active context. It:

1. Starts at `GetFocusedWidget()` (the leaf).
2. Walks `node.Parent` upward.
3. Skips any node whose `IsHidden()` is true.
4. For each node with an `OnHandleInput`, calls it.
5. Returns true the first time a handler returns true (consumed).

Enter activation is focus-owned across its physical key lifecycle only when the
focused path has a matching CAI `InputMap` binding. The manager records the
focused leaf on that binding's first Enter key-down and permits the matching
key-up only while that leaf still owns focus. Civ VI may deliver the same raw
event through multiple always-active contexts, and an activation can
synchronously replace the focused surface between those deliveries. The
down/up ownership rule rejects a duplicate orphaned key-up when the newly
focused path also owns Enter, without retaining an `InputStruct`, delaying the
new surface, or affecting a later complete Enter press. If the recorded owner
leaves `CurrentPath` before CAI receives the release, the manager cancels the
held state during focus application or destroy pruning. This is required for
contexts such as Tutorial Setup, where vanilla consumes the movie-skip Enter
key-up while synchronously removing the CAI movie panel.

Do not apply this ownership rule to paths without an Enter binding. World and
interface-mode actions such as confirming a Move To destination are dispatched
through `Events.InputActionTriggered` and can reach the raw context handler
without a matching key-down. Consuming such an unmatched raw key-up prevents
the game action from firing.

`UIWidget:OnHandleInput` does the default: walks `InputMap` for a binding
whose key, modifier mask, and message type match the incoming event, then
calls its `Action(self)`. Return `true` to consume, `false` to bubble up
to the parent widget, or `nil` to skip this binding and try the next one
in the same widget's `InputMap` (useful for class bindings that defer to
screen-level overrides).

Char input bubbles through `OnCharInput` the same way (used by `List`/`Tree`
type-to-find and `EditBox` typing).

### Adding a binding

```lua
widget:AddInputBindings({
    { Key = Keys.VK_F1, MSG = KeyEvents.KeyUp, Action = function(w) Speak("help") return true end },
    { Key = Keys.S, MSG = KeyEvents.KeyDown, IsControl = true, Action = function(w) DoSave() return true end },
})
```

Binding defaults: `IsShift=false`, `IsControl=false`, `IsAlt=false`,
`MSG=KeyEvents.KeyUp`.

Mac key rule: on the Aspyr macOS build a binding with `IsControl=true` on one of
the four arrow keys also matches with the Command key held (Shift stacking), and
key help speaks it as Command instead of Control. `UIWidget:OnHandleInput` reads
Command through `IsCommandDown()` in `caiUtils.lua` (native `CAI.IsCommandDown`,
with `VK_LWIN` tracking from `UIScreenManager:HandleInput` as the fallback), and
`FormatBinding` uses `IsMacCommandKey(key)`. Command sets no `InputStruct`
modifier flag, so no other binding changes; Alt is Option on Mac.

Non-common bindings are normally consumed without running their action when the
focused widget is disabled. Set `BubbleWhenDisabled=true` on navigation
bindings that should instead continue to an ancestor. Disabled EditBoxes use
this for unmodified Up/Down and Home/End so an inactive field cannot trap
navigation belonging to its containing List; editing and activation bindings
remain blocked.

---

## 9. Navigation

`ContainerWidget` provides the navigation primitives. Concrete container
widgets bind the keys that should call them.

| Method               | Default keys                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| `NavigateNext`       | List Down / HList Right / Panel Tab |
| `NavigatePrev`       | List Up / HList Left / Panel Shift+Tab |
| `NavigateToFirst`    | Home                          |
| `NavigateToLast`     | End                           |
| `NavigatePage(dir)`  | PgUp/PgDn (default page size 10) |

`PageSize` defaults to 10. Override per widget via `SetPageSize(n)` or the
`PageSize` prop. Set to 0 to disable paging on that widget.

### Direction is threaded through

All four navigators pass `{ direction = ±1 }` into `SetFocus`. That direction
controls how the target container is entered (first vs last child). This is
what makes Shift+Tab from a content row into the dialog's button row land on
the **last** button (Cancel), not the first (OK).

### Tree navigation

Trees use flat visible order for Up/Down and paging, while Home/End operate on
the focused row's sibling level. The helper module
`CAIWidgetHelpers_Tree`:

- `Flatten(root)` — pre-order list of every visible TreeItem reachable from
  root, descending only into expanded nodes.
- `NavigateFlat(root, dir)` — Up/Down moves through the flat list.
- `NavigatePage(root, dir, pageSize)` — PgUp/PgDn jumps PageSize positions.
- `NavigateFirst/Last(root)` — Home/End moves to the first/last visible sibling at the focused row's current depth.
- `NavigateTreeFirst/Last(root)` — Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End moves to the first/last row in the flattened visible tree; the last row may be a deep descendant of an expanded final branch.
- The `TreeHomeEndCurrentDepth` UI setting selects which pair plain Home/End uses. It defaults to current-depth navigation; disabling it restores legacy full-tree navigation. Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End remain full-tree regardless.
- `ExpandOrDescend(root)` — Right key: expand if collapsed; descend to first
  child if already expanded.
- `CollapseOrAscend(root)` — Left key: collapse if expanded; jump to parent
  TreeItem if collapsed.
- `ToggleFocused(root)` — Enter key on Tree: toggle focused item's expand
  state. Bubbles only when the focused item has no `activate` listener.

### Type-to-find search

`CAIWidgetHelpers_Search.HandleChar(root, char, maxDepth)`:

- Appends the char to `Manager.SearchBuffer`, with timeout behavior controlled
  by the `SearchTimeout` setting when persistent result navigation is disabled.
- Collects depth-limited candidates and applies the existing match-tier and
  relevance ordering before focusing the first result.
- **Proximity bias (sort only, never a filter)**: every widget that matches the
  query is kept; proximity only *orders* the results so the ones nearest where
  you started typing are offered first. Candidates farther away still appear
  further down the list and remain reachable by cycling — nothing is dropped for
  being far or for matching at a weaker tier. Closeness is the depth of the
  deepest ancestor a candidate shares with the *anchor*: the widget focused when
  the current query began (`Manager.SearchAnchor`, captured on the first
  character and held fixed for the whole query so result cycling stays stable
  even as focus moves). `CompareSearchResults` uses proximity as its top sort
  key, then match-tier / position / length / BFS. When there is no anchor inside
  `root` (e.g. focus is elsewhere), proximity is uniform and ordering falls back
  to the plain global behavior.
- **Accent folding**: query and label text are folded through
  `CAIWidgetHelpers_Search.FoldText`, which lowercases ASCII A–Z and maps
  accented Latin letters (Latin-1 Supplement + Extended-A, both cases) to their
  base ASCII letter, so typing a plain letter matches every accented form
  (`a` matches à/á/â/ã/ä/å/ā, `c` matches ç/č, `n` matches ñ, …). This is how a
  query like `chateau` reaches "Château". Bytes outside the listed Latin ranges
  (e.g. CJK) are left untouched, so non-Latin scripts are never corrupted;
  Vietnamese / Latin Extended Additional (3-byte) is not folded.
- **Same-letter cycling**: pressing the same single letter again while that
  one-character search remains active doesn't extend the buffer. The next
  search starts after the focused
  match, cycling through every item starting with that letter. Matches the
  JAWS/NVDA convention.
- The default-enabled `TypeToFindResultNavigation` UI setting turns the ranked
  matches into a persistent flat result list. While its buffer is non-empty,
  Up/Down move to the previous/next result and wrap at the ends. The timeout is
  suspended without changing result collection or sorting.
- The default-enabled `TypeToFindIncludeTooltips` UI setting adds tooltip-only
  matches after label matches. Labels and tooltips retain the same six-tier
  classifier independently, so a strong tooltip match never displaces or
  outranks an available label match. Widgets whose labels match at any tier are
  not duplicated through their tooltips.
- A persistent search is owned by the container where typing began. Moving
  focus outside that container clears it silently. A successful widget
  interaction also clears it silently: activation, value or text changes,
  dropdown open/close, TreeItem or SubMenu expand/collapse, and entering an
  EditBox or an already-expanded TreeItem. Programmatic silent refreshes do not
  clear it. After clearing, ordinary widget navigation resumes immediately.
- When the type-to-find buffer is non-empty, manager-level `Escape` clears it
  and speaks `Search cleared`. `Backspace` removes the last character; if that
  empties the buffer, it also speaks `Search cleared`.
- `CAIWidgetHelpers_Search.MatchSearchText(label, query)` exposes the same
  start-whole-word, start-prefix, whole-word, word-prefix, substring, and
  word-prefix-abbreviation classifier to non-widget consumers. It returns the
  best `SearchResult` tier for that label or `nil` when the label does not
  match; callers retain ownership of result grouping and tie-breaking.

Wire it up on a container:

```lua
function MyList:OnCharInput(char)
    return CAIWidgetHelpers_Search.HandleChar(self, char, self.SearchDepth)
end
```

`SearchDepth` defaults: List = 2, Tree = 3.

A container can implement `GetTypeToFindCandidates(includeTooltips)` to replace
the normal depth-limited descendant collection while retaining the shared
buffer, six-tier ranking, repeat-letter cycling, Backspace/Escape behavior, and
persistent Up/Down result navigation. Build each custom candidate with
`CAIWidgetHelpers_Search.MakeSearchCandidate(widget, label, order, tooltip)`.
`Grid` uses this hook to search every visible item cell across all
columns and tiers. `DataTable` uses it to search only its primary row labels;
each result targets that row's cell in the currently focused column.

### Ctrl+F search panel

`ContainerWidget` owns the Ctrl+F search integration. Every container has an
`AllowSearch` flag (default `false`). When `AllowSearch` is true and the user
presses Ctrl+F, the container opens a `SearchPanelWidget` overlay that indexes
descendants via the game's `Search.*` API, presents matching results as a
navigable list, and jumps to the selected widget on activation.

**Lists and Trees enable search by default** — they set `AllowSearch = true` in
their constructors. All other containers (Panel, Dialog, TabPage, etc.) keep it
off unless explicitly enabled.

#### Enabling search

```lua
-- Enable with default widget-label indexing:
myPanel:EnableSearch()
-- or
myPanel:SetAllowSearch(true)

-- Enable with a custom query handler (implicitly sets AllowSearch = true):
myTree:SetSearchQueryHandler(function(query, maxResults)
    -- Return a list of { key, label, onActivate?, widget?, tooltip? }
    return results
end)

-- Full-text contexts can receive the complete query once:
myTree:SetSearchQueryMode("raw")

-- Disable:
myPanel:DisableSearch()
```

#### Custom query handlers

A query handler receives `(query, maxResults)` and must return a list of result
tables. Each result has:

- `key` — string, used as `FocusKey` on the result button.
- `label` — string, the display text for this result.
- `onActivate` — optional function, called when the user activates the result.
  If omitted and `widget` is present, focus jumps to that widget.
- `widget` — optional `UIWidget`, the target for focus-jump on activation.

When no custom handler is set, the SearchPanel walks the container's descendants,
collects their speech text, builds a `Search.*` context, and matches against it.

The default query mode is `"terms"`. The panel parses the edit text into
whitelisted terms, intersects their result sets, and subtracts `--term` matches.
A custom handler is therefore called once for each parsed term. This behavior is
well suited to labels in maps, trees, and ordinary lists.

Call `container:SetSearchQueryMode("raw")` for a full-text index. Raw mode passes
the complete edit-box string to the custom handler once, without CAI term or
exclusion parsing, and preserves the search provider's phrase ranking and
preview. If no custom handler is installed, the full string is passed once to
the panel's `Search.*` context.

#### Accessing the search panel from a screen

```lua
-- Forward results programmatically while the panel is open:
container:SetSearchResults(myResults)

-- Get the active search panel (nil if not open on this container):
local panel = container:GetSearchPanel()
```

The manager owns a single shared `SearchPanelWidget` instance. When
`mgr:OpenSearch(container)` is called, it applies the container's stored query
handler and query mode to the panel before opening it.

The result list always contains an empty-state row when there are no results.
It reads `Type text to search` while the edit box is empty and `No results`
after a nonempty query. The empty-state row is never auto-focused. If a rebuild
destroys a focused result, focus remains on the result-list container.

The UI setting `AutoFocusFirstSearchResult` controls whether a successful
result rebuild moves focus to the first result. It defaults to enabled. When
disabled, rebuilding results does not explicitly move focus.

### Manager-bound widget helpers

`mgr.WidgetHelpers` is a per-manager table of quick widget builders. Helper
modules contribute to it by exposing an `Install(mgr)` function that closes
over the owning manager and binds named methods. Screens then call
`mgr.WidgetHelpers.X(...)` without threading the manager through every call,
and the manager keeps full ownership of its helpers — no module-global state.

Currently installed at init:

- `mgr.WidgetHelpers.MakeGeneralDialog(titleFn, buttons, contentRows?, defaultIndex?)`
- `mgr.WidgetHelpers.CreatePopupDialog(popup)` — vanilla `PopupDialog` wrapper.

To add a new builder: define `YourHelper.Install(mgr)` that assigns closures
onto `mgr.WidgetHelpers`, then call it from `UIScreenManager:Init()` alongside
the existing `CAIWidgetHelpers_DialogBuilder.Install(mgr)`.

---

## 10. TabControl

`TabControlWidget` owns its tabs and pages — there's no separate "tab strip"
widget that screens need to manage. `AddPage(labelOrFn)` creates the Tab and
TabPage internally and returns the TabPage to populate.

```lua
local tabs = mgr:CreateWidget("CityPanel_Tabs", "TabControl", { Label = ... })
-- WrapAround defaults to true; call tabs:SetWrapAround(false) to opt out.

local overview = tabs:AddPage(function() return Locale.Lookup("LOC_OVERVIEW") end)
overview:AddChild(headerStaticText)
overview:AddChild(actionsList)

local citizens = tabs:AddPage(function() return Locale.Lookup("LOC_CITIZENS") end)
citizens:AddChild(citizenTable)

tabs:On("value_changed", function(_, idx)
    Speak("Switched to tab " .. tostring(idx))
end)
```

### Internal structure

`tabs.Children` is always `[_tabStrip, activePage]`. The strip is a
HorizontalList of Tab widgets; non-active pages live in `_pages[]` but are
detached from the children list. `SetActivePage(i)` swaps slot 2.

### Navigation

- First-time entry into the TabControl (no prior focus inside) lands on the
  active page, not the tab strip. `GetDefaultChild` / `GetEntryChild` both
  return the active page.
- Left/Right within the strip cycles tabs and immediately activates the
  page (via the `focus_enter` → `_OnTabFocused` hook on each Tab).
- `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` cycles tabs from anywhere inside the
  TabControl (bindings live on the TabControl itself; input bubbles up).
  Focus follows the user's current context: if they're in the tab strip the
  new tab is focused; otherwise the new page is focused so they can keep
  working in page content.
- Tab / Shift+Tab inside the control behave as standard ContainerWidget
  navigation — strip is child 1, active page is child 2.

## 11. Grid, Graph, and DataTable

`Grid` uses a three-level hierarchy: **Grid → Column → Tier → item cell**.

- **Column** is a labeled group (e.g. a civics-tree era). It speaks only its
  header label — role and position are muted — and owns its cells through
  tiers. Because of that ownership, the manager's focus-divergence machinery
  announces the column header automatically when, and only when, focus crosses
  into a new column. No custom speech code.
- **Tier** is a side-by-side sub-column inside a column. A column of `width` N
  holds N tiers laid out left-to-right. Tiers are `Transparent` — they
  contribute nothing of their own to speech.
- **Item cell** is an arbitrary widget stacked vertically inside a tier. Its
  position element uses the same row/column wording as a data-table cell.
  Tiers are internal only: each visible tier counts as one spoken column, in
  flattened left-to-right order across the grid. The row coordinate retains
  the raw spatial child index so uneven tiers and hidden alignment spacers do
  not shift cells into a different reported row.

A plain grid is the degenerate case: every column has one tier (`width`
defaults to 1), so Left/Right walks columns and Up/Down walks rows, and each
column header is announced as you move across.

```lua
-- Plain grid
local grid = mgr:CreateWidget(id, "Grid", { Label = ... })
grid:AddColumn({ header = "Unit" })
grid:AddColumn({ header = "Health" })
for _, unit in ipairs(units) do
    grid:AddRow({ cellStaticText(unit.name), cellStaticText(unit.healthString) })
end

-- Multi-tier (civics tree: era column with several tiers side by side)
local era = grid:AddColumn({ header = eraName, width = 3 })
grid:AddItem(era, 1, civicWidget)   -- tier 1, appended vertically
grid:AddItem(era, 2, otherCivic)    -- tier 2
```

| Method                          | What                                          |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `AddColumn({ header, width? })` | Append a column (width = tier count); returns the column widget |
| `GetColumnCount / GetColumnWidget(i)` |                                         |
| `GetTier(column, tierIndex?)`   | Tier widget (column = widget or index)        |
| `AddItem(column, tierIndex, w)` | Append a cell into a tier; returns item index |
| `AddRow(cells)`                 | Grid convenience: one cell per column, tier 1 |
| `SetCell(row, col, widget)`     | Replace/insert a grid cell in column's tier 1 |
| `GetCell(row, col)`             | Grid cell from column's tier 1                |
| `GetRowCount`                   | Longest first-tier stack across columns       |
| `RemoveRow(row)`                | Destroys the row-th cell in each column's tier 1 |
| `ClearRows`                     | Destroys all cells; keeps column/tier structure |

### Grid navigation

All navigation lives on the `GridWidget` (it reads the live focus leaf via
`Manager:GetFocusedWidget()`). Hidden and empty cells are **skipped in the
direction of travel** — never landed on. There is no wrap; reaching an edge
with no candidate returns false so input bubbles to the parent.

- **Up / Down** — move within the focused cell's tier.
- **Left / Right** — step to the adjacent tier in the flattened tier list
  (across all columns), landing on the cell at the same vertical index
  (clamped). Crossing a column boundary triggers the header announce.
- **Home / End** — first / last visible cell in the current tier.
- **Ctrl+Home / Ctrl+End** — grid-wide first / last navigable cell.
- **Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right** — jump to the first cell of the previous / next
  column.

Typing searches every visible item cell in every column and tier. The shared
type-to-find result set applies: repeated initial letters cycle matches,
Backspace edits the query, Escape clears it, and Up/Down move through ranked
results while the query remains active. Tooltip-only cell matches participate
when the global type-to-find tooltip setting is enabled.

### Graphs

`GraphWidget` presents arbitrary widgets as nodes in a directed relationship
graph. The screen adds every node first, then adds edges with
`AddEdge(fromKey, toKey)`. Graph owns adjacency, deterministic neighbor order,
relationship navigation, optional labeled groups, and type-to-find; the node
widget retains its normal role, live label/tooltip/state, activation listeners,
and screen-specific `focus_enter` behavior.

```lua
local graph = mgr:CreateWidget(id, "Graph", { Label = graphLabel })
graph:AddGroup({ key = eraType, label = eraLabel })
graph:AddNode(itemType, itemButton, { group = eraType })
graph:AddEdge(prerequisiteType, itemType)
```

Node insertion order is the stable order used for incoming, outgoing, root,
and alternative sets. `AddEdge` requires both endpoints to exist. Duplicate
edges are ignored. The graph does not assume acyclic data: it follows only one
edge per command, so reciprocal relationships are safe.

Optional groups are internal `GraphGroup` containers. They speak only their
label and own their nodes in the real widget ancestry. Moving between eras or
other groups therefore announces the new group through normal focus divergence;
Graph never calls `Speak()` for focus movement. Nodes without an explicit group
are placed in one transparent default group. Screens should add a group only
when they will add at least one node to it. A group must not derive its own
hidden state by calling `GetVisibleChildren()`: child visibility includes the
parent hidden state, so that predicate would recurse through parent and child.

Manager focus remains authoritative. `GetFocusedNodeKey()` walks from
`Manager:GetFocusedWidget()` through its ancestors to the registered graph
node. Every navigation command resolves that live key. Graph caches only the
alternative set established by the previous incoming/outgoing traversal; when
focus changes externally through search, `RestoreFocus`, or `SetFocus`, the
next command detects the new key and reseeds alternatives.

A graph node's position is its index in that same live alternative set, so the
spoken total is exactly the set Up/Down can traverse. Groups are structural and
do not contribute a position. A node reached outside ordinary edge navigation
reseeds its alternatives before its focus announcement is built.

Navigation:

- **Right** follows the first visible outgoing edge; all visible outgoing
  nodes from the source become the alternative set.
- **Left** follows the first visible incoming edge; all visible incoming nodes
  to the source become the alternative set. If the selected incoming node is a
  root, the alternative set changes to all visible roots, matching Civ V's
  root-swap behavior.
- **Up / Down** moves through the previous/next alternative. `WrapAround`
  controls alternative wrapping and defaults to true.
- **Home / End** moves to the first/last current alternative.
- **Ctrl+Home / Ctrl+End** moves to the first/last visible root.

Hidden nodes are excluded from navigation, roots, alternatives, and search;
Graph does not traverse through them to invent shortcut edges. Disabled nodes
remain readable and focusable, while their own widgets continue to govern
activation. Type-to-find searches every visible graph node, including tooltip
matches when enabled, and Up/Down browses ranked search results before ordinary
alternative navigation.

For rebuilds, use the standard container focus contract:

```lua
local capture = mgr:CaptureFocusKey(graph)
graph:ClearGraph()
-- Add groups, nodes in stable order, then edges.
mgr:RestoreFocus(graph, capture)
```

Public methods are `AddGroup`, `AddNode`, `AddEdge`, `GetNode`,
`GetFocusedNodeKey`, `SetDefaultNode`, `FocusNode`, `GetIncoming`,
`GetOutgoing`, `GetRoots`, `GetNodePositionString`, and `ClearGraph`.

### Data tables

`DataTableWidget` is the homogeneous-row companion to `GridWidget`.
They share cell navigation and type-to-find behavior, but expose distinct
localized player-facing roles: `Table` and `Grid`.
Use `DataTable` when every row represents one stable record and columns expose
live comparable values. Use `Grid` for technology/civic layouts and other
spatial or multi-tier arrangements whose cells are arbitrary widgets. Sorting
belongs to `DataTable`; `Grid` does not define a sorting model.

The screen supplies row records, stable row keys, a primary row label, and
column definitions. A record should normally be a stable game id or a small
table of ids; every label, tooltip, state, disabled predicate, and sort key is
read live through its getter.

```lua
local tableView = mgr:CreateWidget("CAICities_Data", "DataTable", {
    Label = function() return Locale.Lookup("LOC_REPORTS_CITIES") end,
})

tableView:SetColumns({
    {
        key = "name",
        header = GetLocalizedNameHeader,
        getCell = function(cityID) return GetLiveCityName(cityID) end,
        sortKey = function(cityID) return GetLiveCityName(cityID) end,
        sortAscendingDescription = "LOC_CAI_SORT_A_TO_Z",
        sortDescendingDescription = "LOC_CAI_SORT_Z_TO_A",
    },
    {
        key = "population",
        header = GetLocalizedPopulationHeader,
        getCell = function(cityID) return tostring(GetLivePopulation(cityID)) end,
        sortKey = function(cityID) return GetLivePopulation(cityID) end,
        sortAscendingDescription = "LOC_CAI_SORT_LOWEST_FIRST",
        sortDescendingDescription = "LOC_CAI_SORT_HIGHEST_FIRST",
    },
})
tableView:SetRowsProvider(GetLiveCityIDs)
tableView:SetRowKeyGetter(function(cityID) return cityID end)
tableView:SetRowLabelGetter(GetLiveCityName)
tableView:SetDefaultSort({ column = "name", ascending = true })
tableView:Rebuild()
```

Column fields are:

- `key`: required stable string identity.
- `header`: required localized string or live getter.
- `getCell(row)`: required live spoken cell value.
- `sortKey(row)`: optional live sortable value. Its presence makes the header
  cell sortable.
- `sortAscendingDescription` and `sortDescendingDescription`: required
  localization tags whenever `sortKey` is present. They describe the actual
  player-facing order, such as `A to Z`, `nearest first`, `weakest first`, or
  `ready first`. The active header appends this semantic description instead
  of exposing the implementation terms ascending and descending. Companion
  sort dropdowns should build their option labels from the same fields.
- `getTooltip(row)`, `getState(row)`, and `isDisabled(row)`: optional live
  widget metadata.

Every header and data widget retains the localized `TableCell` role. Its
transparent parent has the localized `TableRow` role. To make rows actionable,
register `tableView:On("row_activate", fn)` before the first `Rebuild()`. The
row container then owns Enter and Space, input bubbles from every cell in that
row, and the event receives `(row, rowWidget)`. Cells never change role or own
a screen action merely because their row is actionable.

`Rebuild()` re-reads the row provider, applies the current sort, recreates the
grid, and restores the logical cell by its generated row-key/column-key
`FocusKey`. Sorts are stable: equal values retain the row provider's order,
localized strings use `Locale.Compare`, and nil values remain last in either
direction. `SetDefaultSort(...)` seeds the initial active sort; clearing a sort
returns to the provider's natural order. `GetSort()` returns the active column
key (or `nil`) and its ascending flag, which lets a screen retain a sort while
replacing dynamic column definitions.

The header is a real row above the data. Enter or Space on a sortable header
cycles descending, ascending, then natural order, while speaking the column's
semantic order description for the first two states. Up/Down moves through the
header and data rows; Left/Right moves through columns. Home/End moves to the
first/last data row in the current column. Shift+Home/Shift+End moves to the
first/last column on the current row, including the header row.
Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End moves to the first/last table cell, and
Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right moves to the adjacent column's header. Navigation does
not wrap.

Typing searches only the primary label supplied by `SetRowLabelGetter`; cell
values, headers, states, and tooltips are intentionally excluded. A match lands
on that row in the currently focused column, so finding a record does not
discard column context. The standard repeat-letter, Backspace, Escape, and
persistent Up/Down result behavior applies.

Speech tracks logical coordinates independently from the widget ancestry:

- Initial entry speaks row label, column header, and cell value.
- A vertical move speaks the new row label and cell value without repeating
  the unchanged column.
- A horizontal move speaks the new column header and cell value without
  repeating the unchanged row label.
- Exact duplicate row-label/header/value fragments are omitted.
- Position speech reports both data-row and column coordinates. Header
  position speech reports its column coordinate.

Every header carries the silent `TableCell` role. Sortable headers retain that
role and add activation bindings only for cycling their sort. When a table has
a `row_activate` listener, every data cell reaches the same row-owned action.

The widget emits the following events. As with all widget events, the DataTable
itself is the first listener argument.

- `row_focus_enter(row, rowIndex, cell)` when focus enters a different logical
  row. Header focus supplies nil row and index 0.
- `cell_focus_enter(row, column, cell)` on every cell focus entry.
- `row_activate(row, rowWidget)` when Enter or Space bubbles from any cell in
  an actionable row.
- `sort_changed(columnKey, ascending)` after a header changes the sort. Natural
  order supplies nil column key.
- `rebuilt(rowCount)` after a completed rebuild.

`GetFocusedRow()` and `GetFocusedColumn()` let table-level input bindings
resolve their current live record.

Each data row carries a stable row-level FocusKey, `<tableId>:row:<rowKey>`, in
addition to the per-cell keys `<tableId>:row:<rowKey>:<columnKey>`. To restore
focus onto a record after an external rebuild, target the row key, not a cell:
`mgr:PrepareFocus(table, tableId .. ":row:" .. tostring(rowKey))`. The table
remembers the last focused column (persisted across focus leaving and
returning), and a freshly rebuilt row with no focus cache of its own descends to
that remembered column, so the user keeps the column they were reading instead
of snapping back to column one. Vertical navigation keeps the column on its own;
this only governs entry into a row from outside.

## 12. Dialog

`DialogWidget` is the host for modal popups. Tab / Shift+Tab / Up / Down all
navigate dialog rows (content rows + the button row, in that order). Home moves
to the first visible content control, while End moves to the final visible
action button. If a focused descendant owns Home or End, such as a List or
EditBox, that specialized binding handles the key before it reaches the dialog.

```lua
local d = mgr:CreateWidget(id, "Dialog", { Label = titleFn })
d:AddChildren(contentRows)
d:SetButtons({okBtn, cancelBtn}, 1)   -- defaultIndex = OK
mgr:Push(d, { priority = PopupPriority.Current })
```

`SetButtons(buttons, defaultIndex)` auto-creates a `Transparent` Panel as the
last child of the dialog and wires Left/Right + Up/Down across its buttons.
Because the row does not wrap, Up/Down at its edges bubble back to dialog-row
navigation. The method also sets the default action widget; Enter on the dialog
fires that widget's `activate`.

`GetActionButtons()` and `GetContent()` return the button-row children and
all other (non-button-row) children respectively.

---

## 13. Adding a new widget

1. **Pick the base class.** Navigable container → `ContainerWidget`.
   Stateful value with bound setter → `ValueWidget`. Leaf / simple → `UIWidget`.
2. **Create the file** in `src/UI/uiManager/CAIWidget_<Name>.lua`. The `CAI`
   prefix is required to avoid VFS collisions with vanilla Lua names.
3. **Declare the class** with metatable chain:

   ```lua
   ---@class MyWidget : ContainerWidget
   MyWidget = setmetatable({}, { __index = ContainerWidget })
   MyWidget.__index = MyWidget
   ```

4. **Write `Create(mgr, id, props)`**. Start with the parent constructor,
   set `Id`/`Type`/`Role`/`Manager`, add input bindings, hook events, apply
   props last:

   ```lua
   function MyWidget.Create(mgr, id, props)
       local w = ContainerWidget.New(MyWidget)
       w.Id = id
       w.Type = "MyWidget"
       w.Role = "MyWidget"
       w.Manager = mgr
       w:AddInputBindings({ ... })
       CAIWidgetRegistry.ApplyProps(w, props)
       return w
   end
   ```

5. **Add public methods** as needed.
6. **Register** at the bottom:

   ```lua
   CAIWidgetRegistry.Register("MyWidget", MyWidget.Create)
   ```

7. **Include** in `CAIUIScreenManager.lua` (`include("CAIWidget_MyWidget")`)
   before the manager's `Init` call.
8. **Add to `.modinfo`** in all three blocks: top-level `<Files>`, FrontEnd
   `<ImportFiles>`, InGame `<ImportFiles>`.
9. **Add LuaLS annotations** to `src/ideHelpers.lua`.

---

## 14. Binding vanilla controls

The recurring pattern in CAI screens. The CAI widget mirrors live vanilla
state — never caches displayed values, always reads through to the control.

```lua
local btn = mgr:CreateWidget(id, "Button", {
    Label   = function() return vanillaButton:GetText() or "" end,
    Tooltip = function() return vanillaButton:GetToolTipString() or "" end,
})
btn:SetHiddenPredicate(function() return vanillaButton:IsHidden() end)
btn:SetDisabledPredicate(function() return vanillaButton:IsDisabled() end)
btn:On("activate", function() vanillaButton:CallCallback("Click") end)
```

For checkboxes:

```lua
check:SetChecked(vanillaCheck:IsChecked(), true)
check:SetValueSetter(function(_, v)
    if vanillaCheck:IsChecked() ~= v then vanillaCheck:DoLeftClick() end
end)
```

For edit boxes wrapping a vanilla `EditBox`:

```lua
edit:SetText(vanillaEdit:GetText() or "", true)
edit:SetValueSetter(function(_, text) vanillaEdit:SetText(text) end)
-- SetValueSetter is also called on Commit.
-- Enter commits by default. Set edit:SetEnterToCommit(false) to bubble instead.
```

---

## 15. File layout

```
src/UI/uiManager/
  CAIUIScreenManager.lua          entry point
  CAIWidgetRegistry.lua           type-name → ctor map
  CAIWidget_Base.lua              UIWidget
  CAIWidget_Container.lua         ContainerWidget
  CAIWidget_Value.lua             ValueWidget
  CAIWidget_Button.lua
  CAIWidget_MenuItem.lua
  CAIWidget_StaticText.lua
  CAIWidget_Panel.lua
  CAIWidget_Dialog.lua
  CAIWidget_List.lua
  CAIWidget_HorizontalList.lua
  CAIWidget_SubMenu.lua
  CAIWidget_Tree.lua
  CAIWidget_TreeItem.lua
  CAIWidget_Dropdown.lua
  CAIWidget_Checkbox.lua
  CAIWidget_Slider.lua
  CAIWidget_EditBox.lua
  CAIWidget_TabControl.lua
  CAIWidget_Tab.lua
  CAIWidget_TabPage.lua
  CAIWidget_Grid.lua
  CAIWidget_Graph.lua
  CAIWidget_DataTable.lua
  CAIWidget_GameView.lua
  CAIWidget_InterfaceMode.lua
  CAIWidget_SearchPanel.lua
  helpers/
    CAIWidgetHelpers_Navigation.lua
    CAIWidgetHelpers_Search.lua
    CAIWidgetHelpers_Tree.lua
    CAIWidgetHelpers_EditBox.lua
    CAIWidgetHelpers_DialogBuilder.lua
```

Include order matters: `CAIUIScreenManager.lua` includes every widget file
**before** calling `UIScreenManager:Init()`, so the registry is fully
populated by the time anyone calls `CreateWidget`.

## 16. Migration guide for screens

When migrating a screen from the old template-merged manager:

1. **Replace `mgr:CreateUIWidget(id, type, props)`** with `mgr:CreateWidget(id, type, props)`.
2. **Replace single-callback fields**:
   - `OnClick = fn` → `w:On("activate", fn)`
   - `OnFocusEnter = fn` → `w:On("focus_enter", fn)`
   - `OnFocusLeave = fn` → `w:On("focus_leave", fn)`
   - `OnCommit = fn` → `w:On("value_changed", fn)` (EditBox emits it on Commit; programmatic refresh uses `SetText(text, true)` silent so it doesn't fire)
   - `OnValueChanged = fn` → `w:On("value_changed", fn)`
   - `OnToggleExpanded = fn` → `w:On("expanded", fn)` / `w:On("collapsed", fn)`
3. **Replace `widget.FocusedChild = X` and `widget:SetFocusedChild(N)`** with
   `mgr:SetFocus(child)` or `mgr:Push(root, { focus = child })`.
4. **Replace rebuild-and-restore dances** with:
   - Set `FocusKey` on rebuilt rows.
   - `local capture = mgr:CaptureFocusKey(root)`
   - rebuild
   - `mgr:RestoreFocus(root, capture)`
5. **Replace `w:SpeakElements(...)`** with `w:Announce(...)` (the legacy name
   still works).
6. **Replace `OnFocusEnter = function() UI.PlaySound("X") end`** with
   `w:SetFocusSound("X")`.
7. **Replace manual tab-row screens** (toggle IsHidden on sibling containers)
   with a `TabControl` + `AddPage` per tab.
8. **Replace ad-hoc dialog assembly** (Dialog + button-row Panel +
   default-action wiring) with `Dialog:SetButtons(buttons, defaultIndex)` or
   `mgr.WidgetHelpers.MakeGeneralDialog(titleFn, buttons, contentRows, defaultIndex)`.
9. **Old type-name aliases** (`Treeview` → `Tree`, `TreeviewItem` → `TreeItem`,
   `Edit` → `EditBox`, `TabBar` → not directly mapped; screens that used
   `TabBar` should migrate to `TabControl`) need explicit renames in
   `CreateWidget` calls.

---

## 17. Don'ts

- Don't read or write `w.FocusedChild` directly — use `mgr:SetFocus(w)` or
  `w:GetFocusedChild()` (manager-derived).
- Don't keep widget references across rebuilds — the path may contain dead
  references for a single frame before the next `SetFocus` call. Use
  `FocusKey` + `RestoreFocus` instead.
- Don't call `Speak()` for focus-driven announcements — the manager does it.
  Use `w:Announce()` or `mgr:Refocus()` for out-of-band re-announces.
- Don't add `OnHandleInput` overrides that always return true; that breaks
  bubbling. Return false when you didn't actually handle the input.
- Don't bypass `BeginEdit`/`Commit`/`Cancel` on EditBox by writing `_buffer`
  directly. Use `SetText` for committed text; the buffer is a working copy.
- Don't pass display-time strings to `SetLabel` — pass either a literal or a
  getter function so live values stay live.
